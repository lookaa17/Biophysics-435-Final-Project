# Biophysics-435-Final-Project

Done so far:
- trained model to predict base-paring
  - MLP model
  - Random Forest model
  - (deepchem model not implemented yet - transformers?)
- uploaded csv data files being used to train models (50pts)

Left to do:
- train a model for the SASA data
  - Multitask Regressor
  - MLP model probably
- write a research report (250 pts)
- finish the code then put a copy of the Colab notebook in (250 pts)
